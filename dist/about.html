              I do a lot of things but the common theme among them all is that
              they all require constant hard work. I'm very active, and I enjoy
              running, lifting, and training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I'm also a
              huge fan of MMA, it's the only sport I watch and every Saturday is
              fight night .
            </p>
            <p>
              Along with physical pursuits I have nerdier hobbies as well. I
              enjoy learning and reading about history, particularly American
              history 1900 and onwards.
            </p>

              I'm a CS major but I didn't enjoy the field until I actually
              started working on projects and technologies relevant to modern
              development. Since getting familiar with actual development beyond
              an academic setting, I've grown to enjoy the process of
              programming. Recently I've been focused on improving my UI design
              skills
            </p>
            <p>
              Above all I thrive on being constantly active both physically and
              mentally. I know what it means to work hard and work through
              difficult situations such as recovering from injuries sustained
              while training. It's this spirit of hard work that I hope to bring
              to my future employers. Please checkout my
